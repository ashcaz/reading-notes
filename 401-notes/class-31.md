## A Beginners's Guide to Docker

### Linux Containers

Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.

### Install Docker

`Docker Compose` is an additional tool that is automatically included with Mac and Windows downloads of Docker. However if you are on Linux, you will need to add it manually. You can do this by running the command `sudo pip install docker-compose` after your Docker installation is complete.

```Bash
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.24.1, build 4667896b
```

Now run the command below to confirm you have a working version of it, too. The version should be at least 1.24.x.
