## Classes and Objects

To create a class, use the keyword **class**:

```Python
class MyClass:
  x = 5
```

Use the class named MyClass to create objects:

```Python
class MyClass:
  x = 5

p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
```
A very basic class would look something like this:

```Python
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")
    
myobjectx = MyClass()
```
To access the variable inside of the newly created object "myobjectx" you would do the following:

```Python
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")
    
myobjectx = MyClass()

print(myobjectx.variable)
```

output would equal 'blah'
