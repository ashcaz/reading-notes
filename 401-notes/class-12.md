## 10 minutes to pandas

### What is Pandas?

Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.

It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

### Why Use Pandas?

Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.

Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.

Relevant data is very important in data science.

### What Can Pandas Do?

Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:

- Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
- What is average value?
- Max value?
- Min value?

## Real Python - Pandas Tutorial

Pandas is a game-changer for data science and analytics, particularly if you came to Python because you were searching for something more powerful than Excel and VBA. Pandas uses fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with relational or labeled data both easy and intuitive.
